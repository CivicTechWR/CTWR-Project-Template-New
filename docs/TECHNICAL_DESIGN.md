## Architecture Overview

```
[Add architecture diagram or simple text description]

Example:
User Browser → Frontend (React) → API (Node.js) → Database (PostgreSQL)
                ↓
         External Services (e.g., Open Data APIs)
```

## Data Architecture

### Data Sources

- **External APIs:** [What external data sources?]
- **Open Data:** [Any government or public datasets?]

### Data Privacy Considerations
- [ ] No personal identifiable information (PII) stored without explicit consent
- [ ] Data retention policy defined
- [ ] GDPR/privacy compliance considered
- [ ] Data security measures planned

### Database Schema (if applicable)
```sql
-- Example table structures
-- Users table (if needed)
-- Main entity tables
-- Relationship tables
```

PUT /api/[resource]/:id - [Description]
DELETE /api/[resource]/:id - [Description]
```

### Data Formats
```json
{
  "example": "JSON structure for key data objects"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Users:** [Estimated number of users]
- **Data Volume:** [Estimated data size]
- **Geographic Scope:** [Local, regional, etc.]

### Optimization Strategies
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy
- [ ] Database indexing
- [ ] CDN usage (if applicable)

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast standards
- [ ] Alternative text for images
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Automated accessibility testing tools
- [ ] Manual testing with assistive technologies
- [ ] User testing with diverse abilities

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- **Branching Strategy:** [e.g., Git Flow, feature branches]
- **Code Review Process:** [PR requirements]
- **Deployment Process:** [How code gets to production]

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** [Framework/approach]
- **Integration Tests:** [What you'll test]
- **User Acceptance Testing:** [How you'll validate with users]

### Development Environment
```bash
# Setup commands
git clone [repo-url]
cd [project-name]
[installation commands]
[run commands]
```

## Third-Party Integrations

### APIs & Services
| Service | Purpose | Cost | Backup Plan |
|---------|---------|------|-------------|
| [Service 1] | [Purpose] | [Free/Paid] | [Alternative] |
| [Service 2] | [Purpose] | [Free/Paid] | [Alternative] |

### Data Sources
| Source | Type | Update Frequency | Reliability |
|--------|------|------------------|-------------|
| [Source 1] | [API/CSV/etc] | [Daily/Weekly] | [High/Med/Low] |

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to address] |
| [Risk 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to address] |

### Dependency Risks
- **External API Reliability:** [What if external service goes down?]
- **Library Maintenance:** [What if key library becomes unmaintained?]
- **Team Skill Gaps:** [What if key team member leaves?]

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- How could this grow beyond the initial scope?
- What technical changes would be needed for wider adoption?

### Maintainability
- Who will maintain this after the season ends?
- How can you make it easy for future volunteers?

### Sustainability
- What are the ongoing costs (hosting, domains, services)?
- How can the community continue supporting this?
