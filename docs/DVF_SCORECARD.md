# DVF Scorecard for CivicTechWR Projects

> **When to use:** Week 1-3 for initial assessment, Week 6 for mid-season check-in

This scorecard helps teams decide **what to back, how much to back it, and what to learn next**—fast. It's adapted from IDEO's DVF framework specifically for civic tech projects where the "product" is often a public good and the fuel is volunteers.

## The Four Lenses (Score 1-5 each)

### 1. Community Partner (1-5 points)
**Will partners consistently participate and bring real value back to the CTWR community?**

- **5 - Exceptional**: Committed champion with decision-making authority, regular weekly participation, clear value exchange to CTWR
- **4 - Strong**: Named contact person, bi-weekly check-ins scheduled, mutual benefit identified
- **3 - Good**: Interested stakeholder identified, monthly touchpoints planned, some reciprocal value
- **2 - Weak**: Potential partner interested but no commitment, unclear value exchange
- **1 - Poor**: No clear community partner or stakeholder engagement

**Key Questions:**
- Do we have a named champion who can make decisions?
- Are they committed to regular participation in our process?
- What value are they bringing back to CTWR (data, connections, feedback, story)?

### 2. Talent & Team Commitment (1-5 points)
**Is the team sized, skilled, diverse—and able to show up weekly?**

- **5 - Exceptional**: 3-5 committed team members, diverse skills, weekly availability confirmed, clear roles
- **4 - Strong**: Core team of 2-3 people, most needed skills covered, regular availability
- **3 - Good**: 2-3 people interested, some skills gaps but enthusiasm to learn
- **2 - Weak**: 1-2 people, significant skill gaps, uncertain availability
- **1 - Poor**: Solo project or no committed team members

**Key Questions:**
- Can we realistically commit to weekly meetups for 12 weeks?
- Do we have the right mix of skills (technical, design, domain knowledge)?
- Is our team diverse in perspectives and backgrounds?

### 3. Technically Exciting (1-5 points)
**Is there genuine maker energy here (new skills, playful learning, meaningful tech)?**

- **5 - Exceptional**: Cutting-edge tech that's valuable to learn, clear innovation opportunity, high maker energy
- **4 - Strong**: Good technology choices that team is excited to learn/use
- **3 - Good**: Solid tech stack, some learning opportunities, moderate excitement
- **2 - Weak**: Basic technology use, limited learning potential
- **1 - Poor**: No significant technical component or learning opportunity

**Key Questions:**
- Are team members excited to build this?
- Will we learn valuable new skills or technologies?
- Is there a meaningful technical challenge or innovation?

### 4. Civic Exciting (1-5 points)
**Is the public-interest story strong, with potential for visible community impact?**

- **5 - Exceptional**: Clear civic impact with measurable outcomes, compelling public story, fits CTWR mission perfectly
- **4 - Strong**: Good civic value, potential for community impact, aligns with civic tech principles
- **3 - Good**: Some public benefit, decent story for community engagement
- **2 - Weak**: Limited civic impact, unclear public benefit
- **1 - Poor**: No clear civic/public interest component

**Key Questions:**
- Does this strengthen Waterloo Region's civic fabric?
- Can we tell a compelling story about public impact?
- Will this be visible and valuable to the broader community?

## Scoring & Action Framework

**Total Score: ___/20**

### 17-20 Points: CTWR-Supported
✅ **Full Support**
- Regular check-ins to support progress
- Priority Demo Day slot (Week 12)
- Featured in conversations with sponsors and partners
- Access to CTWR resources and network

### 13-16 Points: Worth Exploring
🟡 **Conditional Support**
- Continue building with targeted coaching
- Identify specific risks to address
- Mid-season check-in required
- Demo Day slot if time permits

### 8-12 Points: Significant Risks
⚠️ **Proceed with Caution**
- Only proceed if team is eager to de-risk
- Choose one major risk to address immediately
- Consider scoping down or pivoting
- Focus on learning and iteration

### 4-7 Points: Not Supported Right Now
❌ **Learning Mode**
- Welcome to learn in public with minimal CTWR resources
- Encouraged to develop idea further independently
- Re-assess after addressing major gaps
- Community support but no formal backing

## The Two Equations Check

Any working initiative should satisfy both:

1. **Created Value > Captured Value** (participants get more benefit than they "pay")
2. **Captured Value ≥ Cost to Deliver** (the effort is sustainable)

## Using the Scorecard

### Week 1-3: Initial Assessment
- Run scoring as a team or with community input
- Use scores to guide early decisions and scope
- Identify immediate risks to address

### Week 6: Mid-Season Check
- Re-score to track progress
- Adjust project scope based on learnings
- Celebrate improvements, address persistent issues

### Focus Areas by Score Range
- **≤12**: Choose one risk to crush next
- **13-16**: Scope a public demo to learn in front of users
- **17-20**: Lean into momentum with tight cadences and storytelling
