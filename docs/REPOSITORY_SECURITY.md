# Repository Security Configuration

This guide helps you configure GitHub repository security settings for your CivicTechWR project.

## 🚀 Quick Security Setup (5 Minutes)

After creating your repository from this template, enable these essential security features:

### 1. Enable Secret Scanning (Required)

```bash
# Enable secret scanning and push protection
gh repo edit --enable-secret-scanning --enable-secret-scanning-push-protection
```

**Why:** Automatically detects accidentally committed passwords, API keys, and tokens.

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

```bash
# Basic branch protection for main branch
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --input scripts/branch-protection.json
```

**Why:** Prevents direct pushes to main branch, requires pull request reviews.

### 3. Enable Dependabot (Recommended)

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # or "pip", "gradle", etc.
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

**Why:** Automatically updates vulnerable dependencies.

## 🔒 Complete Security Configuration

### Advanced Security (For Sensitive Projects)

#### Code Scanning

Enable GitHub Advanced Security (if available):

name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: javascript # or python, java, etc.
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

#### Security Policy

- [ ] **SECURITY.md file** - Created ✅ (included in template)
- [ ] **Vulnerability disclosure process** - Documented ✅ (included in template)
- [ ] **Security contact information** - Updated with your project details

#### Audit Logging

For organization-owned repositories:

- [ ] **Audit log monitoring** - Regular review of access changes
- [ ] **Repository insights** - Monitor access patterns
- [ ] **Webhook notifications** - Alert on security events

## 🛠️ Automated Security Setup Scripts

### Branch Protection Configuration

Create `scripts/branch-protection.json`:

```json
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["ci", "security-scan", "dependency-check"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": false
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
```

### Security Setup Script

Add to `scripts/setup-security.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🔒 Setting up repository security..."

# Enable secret scanning
echo "Enabling secret scanning..."
gh repo edit --enable-secret-scanning --enable-secret-scanning-push-protection

# Set up branch protection
echo "Setting up branch protection..."
gh api repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --input scripts/branch-protection.json

# Create dependabot config if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f .github/dependabot.yml ]; then
  echo "Creating dependabot configuration..."
  mkdir -p .github
  cat > .github/dependabot.yml << 'EOF'
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
EOF
fi

echo "✅ Repository security setup complete!"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Review security settings in GitHub repository settings"
echo "2. Add team members with appropriate permissions"
echo "3. Set up monitoring for security alerts"
```

### "Our team is small - is this overkill?"

Start with the "Quick Security Setup" (5 minutes), then add features as you grow:

- **1-2 people**: Secret scanning + basic branch protection
- **3-5 people**: Add code reviews and dependency monitoring
- **5+ people**: Full security configuration with monitoring

### "How often should we review security settings?"
