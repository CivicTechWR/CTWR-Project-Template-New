# Project Management Guide for CivicTechWR

This guide explains how to use GitHub Projects for managing your CTWR civic tech project throughout the 12-week season.

## Overview

Each CTWR project uses a GitHub Project to manage tasks, monitor progress, and ensure community accountability throughout the season.

## Getting Started

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup script to create a configured project:

```bash
# From your project repository
./scripts/setup-project.sh
```

#### Prerequisites

1. Install the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) on your workstation.
2. Authenticate with your CivicTechWR credentials: `gh auth login`.
3. Grant the CLI the **project** scope (required for Projects v2 APIs):
   ```bash
   gh auth refresh -s project --hostname github.com
   gh auth status
   ```
   Confirm the output includes `scopes: ... project ...`.
4. Ensure you have permission to create Projects inside the `CivicTechWR` organization—this is the recommended home for new projects (contact org admins if you see a permissions error).
5. If you must host elsewhere, export `CTWR_PROJECT_OWNER=YourOrg` before running the script and confirm your Pages plan supports private deployments.

> 🔁 **Dry-run/testing:** set `CTWR_SKIP_SCOPE_CHECK=1` before running the script to bypass scope validation in CI smoke tests.

#### Example: Cyber Shield Initiative

```text
Enter project name (e.g., 'Accessible Transit App'): Cyber Shield Initiative
Enter CTWR season (e.g., 'Season 6'): Season 7
Create this project? (y/n): y
```

The script provisions project number `123` (example), adds tracking fields, and links it to your repository so your new cybersecurity education program can track Week 1–12 milestones immediately.

This creates a GitHub Project with:

- ✅ Season workflow tracking (Week 1-12, Project phases)
- ✅ Integration with your repository
- ✅ Standard CTWR project structure

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or need to customize:

1. **Create Project**: Go to <https://github.com/orgs/CivicTechWR/projects>
2. **Click "New Project"** → Choose "Board" or "Table" view
3. **Add Custom Fields** (see Field Configuration section below)
4. **Link to Repository**: Project Settings → Link Repository

## Project Structure

### Core Views

**📋 Table View** - Comprehensive task tracking

- All tasks with assignees and timeline
- Sortable by priority and week
- Best for detailed project management

**📋 Board View** - Kanban workflow by status

- Columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
- Drag and drop for status updates
- Best for daily/weekly standups

### Custom Fields Configuration

The template includes these fields:

| Field Name | Type | Options | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------|
| **Season Week** | Single Select | Week 1-12 | Timeline tracking |
| **Project Phase** | Single Select | Pitch → Demo Day | Season workflow stage |

## Task Management Best Practices

### Creating Effective Issues

**Use the CTWR issue template** which includes:

- Community benefit description
- Acceptance criteria
- Accessibility considerations

**Example Good Issue:**

```markdown
## Summary
Implement keyboard navigation for service directory

## User Story
As a screen reader user, I want to navigate the service directory with keyboard only so that I can access city services independently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Screen reader announces navigation
- [ ] Tested with NVDA and VoiceOver
```

### Linking Issues to Projects

**Automatic linking** (if repository is linked):

- New issues automatically appear in project
- Status updates sync between issue and project

**Manual linking**:

1. Go to issue page
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Select your CTWR project
4. Set appropriate fields (week, phase)

### Status Management

**Standard Status Flow:**

1. **Backlog** - Identified but not started
2. **In Progress** - Actively being worked on
3. **Review** - Complete but needs validation
4. **Done** - Completed and validated

**Special Statuses:**

- **Blocked** - Waiting on external dependencies
- **On Hold** - Paused pending decisions
- **Won't Do** - Decided not to implement

## Automation and Workflows

### GitHub Actions Integration

The template includes automated workflows:

**Season Progression:**

- Auto-update week numbers based on season start
- Reminder notifications for key milestones
- Demo Day preparation checklist automation

### Project Templates

**Quick Start Templates:**

- Web application project
- Data analysis project
- Mobile app project
- Community engagement project

Each template includes:

- Pre-configured issue templates
- Standard task breakdowns
- Timeline templates

## Reporting and Analytics

### Weekly Standups

Use project views to facilitate team meetings:

**Agenda Template:**

1. **Progress Review** (10 min) - What's done/in progress
2. **Blockers** (5 min) - What needs help
3. **Week Ahead** (5 min) - Priorities and commitments

### Mid-Season Review (Week 6)

**Review Process:**

1. Export project data to CSV
2. Identify trends and patterns
3. Adjust project scope if needed
4. Update team commitments

### Demo Day Preparation
