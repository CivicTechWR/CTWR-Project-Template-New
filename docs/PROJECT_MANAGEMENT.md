# Project Management Guide for CivicTechWR

This guide explains how to use GitHub Projects for managing your CTWR civic tech project throughout the 12-week season.

## Overview

Each CTWR project uses a GitHub Project with DVF-integrated tracking to manage tasks, monitor progress, and ensure community accountability throughout the season.

## Getting Started

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup script to create a configured project:

```bash
# From your project repository
./scripts/setup-project.sh
```

#### Prerequisites

1. Install the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) on your workstation.
2. Authenticate with your CivicTechWR credentials: `gh auth login`.
3. Grant the CLI the **project** scope (required for Projects v2 APIs):
   ```bash
   gh auth refresh -s project --hostname github.com
   gh auth status
   ```
   Confirm the output includes `scopes: ... project ...`.
4. Ensure you have permission to create Projects inside the `CivicTechWR` organization (contact the org admins if you see a permissions error).
5. (Optional) Export `CTWR_PROJECT_OWNER=YourOrg` if you want to create the project in a different GitHub organization.

> üîÅ **Dry-run/testing:** set `CTWR_SKIP_SCOPE_CHECK=1` before running the script to bypass scope validation in CI smoke tests.

#### Example: Cyber Shield Initiative

```text
Enter project name (e.g., 'Accessible Transit App'): Cyber Shield Initiative
Enter CTWR season (e.g., 'Season 6'): Season 7
Create this project? (y/n): y
```

The script provisions project number `123` (example), adds DVF fields, and links it to your repository so your new cybersecurity education program can track Week 1‚Äì12 milestones immediately.

This creates a GitHub Project with:

- ‚úÖ DVF tracking fields (Community Partner, Talent & Team, Technically Exciting, Civic Exciting)
- ‚úÖ Season workflow tracking (Week 1-12, Project phases)
- ‚úÖ Integration with your repository
- ‚úÖ Standard CTWR project structure

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or need to customize:

1. **Create Project**: Go to <https://github.com/orgs/CivicTechWR/projects>
2. **Click "New Project"** ‚Üí Choose "Board" or "Table" view
3. **Add Custom Fields** (see Field Configuration section below)
4. **Link to Repository**: Project Settings ‚Üí Link Repository

- Acceptance criteria
- Accessibility considerations

**Example Good Issue:**

```markdown
## Summary
Implement keyboard navigation for service directory

## DVF Impact
- Civic Exciting: +1 (improves accessibility)
- Technically Exciting: +0 (standard feature)

## User Story
As a screen reader user, I want to navigate the service directory with keyboard only so that I can access city services independently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Screen reader announces navigation
- [ ] Tested with NVDA and VoiceOver
```

### Linking Issues to Projects

**Automatic linking** (if repository is linked):

- New issues automatically appear in project
- Status updates sync between issue and project

**Manual linking**:

1. Go to issue page
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Select your CTWR project
4. Set appropriate fields (DVF scores, week, phase)

### Status Management

**Standard Status Flow:**

1. **Backlog** - Identified but not started
2. **In Progress** - Actively being worked on
3. **Review** - Complete but needs validation
4. **Done** - Completed and validated

**Special Statuses:**

- **Blocked** - Waiting on external dependencies
- **On Hold** - Paused pending decisions
- **Won't Do** - Decided not to implement
