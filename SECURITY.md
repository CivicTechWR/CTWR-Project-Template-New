## Security Best Practices for CTWR Projects

### For Project Teams

- **Review the [Security Guide](docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md)** before starting development
- **Use secure coding practices** throughout development
- **Enable automated security scanning** in your repository
- **Conduct security reviews** before major releases
- **Train team members** on civic tech security considerations

### For Community Members

- **Report security issues responsibly** - Don't create public issues for vulnerabilities
- **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update project dependencies
- **Follow security guidelines** when contributing code
- **Respect user privacy** when testing or providing feedback

## Civic Tech Security Considerations

### Community Data Protection

CivicTech projects often handle sensitive community data. Special considerations:

- **Privacy by design** - Minimize data collection
- **Transparency** - Be clear about data use
- **Community consent** - Get explicit permission for data collection
- **Secure storage** - Protect any collected data
- **Data retention** - Delete data when no longer needed

### Government Partnership Security

When working with government partners:

- **Understand data classification** - Know sensitivity levels
- **Follow compliance requirements** - Meet government security standards
- **Secure communication** - Use encrypted channels for sensitive discussions
- **Access controls** - Limit who can access government data
- **Audit trails** - Log access to sensitive information

## Security Resources

### For CTWR Teams

- **[Security Guide](docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive security documentation

## Security Acknowledgments

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve civic technology:

- **Responsible disclosure** contributors will be acknowledged
- **Security hall of fame** for significant contributions
- **Reference letters** for security researchers (upon request)
- **Community recognition** at Demo Day or community meetings

## Legal Safe Harbor

CivicTechWR projects support security research conducted in good faith:

- **Authorized testing** - Security research on our public systems is permitted
- **No legal action** - We won't pursue legal action for good faith security research
- **Coordinated disclosure** - We'll work with you on responsible disclosure timelines

### Guidelines for Security Research

- **Don't access user data** - Only test with your own accounts/data
- **Don't disrupt service** - Avoid testing that could impact users
- **Respect privacy** - Don't access personal information
- **Report responsibly** - Follow our disclosure process
- **Give us time** - Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
