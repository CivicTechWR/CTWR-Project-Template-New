Welcome to the CivicTechWR Project Template! This guide will help you navigate the template and get your civic tech project up and running quickly.

## ‚ö° TL;DR: Launch in 30 Minutes

1. Verify prerequisites with `./scripts/setup.sh --check` (Git, Node, gh scopes).
2. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to install dependencies and drop starter files.
3. Kick off a GitHub Project with DVF fields via `./scripts/setup-project.sh`.
4. Apply baseline security settings using `./scripts/setup-security.sh`.
5. In **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** so docs deploy automatically.
6. Customize `README.md`, the DVF scorecard, and the wiki starter pages.

## üéØ Template Overview

This template provides everything you need for a successful CivicTechWR project:

- **DVF Framework Integration** - Built-in assessment tools for project evaluation
- **12-Week Project Lifecycle** - Structured timeline from idea to Demo Day
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - 9+ guides covering all aspects of civic tech development
- **GitHub Integration** - Issue templates, project management, and automated workflows
- **Security & Accessibility** - Best practices for inclusive, secure civic technology

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Use This Template

1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub
2. Name your repository (e.g., `waterloo-transit-tracker`)
3. Clone your new repository locally

### 2. Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [project-name]

# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# Set up GitHub Project with DVF tracking
./scripts/setup-project.sh

# Configure repository security
./scripts/setup-security.sh
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before running `./scripts/setup-project.sh`, install the GitHub CLI and grant it the `project` scope (`gh auth refresh -s project --hostname github.com`). See [Project Management](docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md#prerequisites) for the full checklist.

### 3. Start Your Project Planning

1. Fill out the [Project Pitch](docs/PROJECT_PITCH.md) (Week 1)
2. Complete your [DVF Assessment](docs/DVF_SCORECARD.md) (Week 1-3)
3. Update the README.md with your project details

## üìä Understanding the DVF Framework

The DVF (Desirability-Viability-Feasibility) Framework helps evaluate civic tech projects across four lenses:

- **Community Partner** (5 points) - Will partners participate and bring value to CTWR?
- **Talent & Team** (5 points) - Is the team sized, skilled, diverse, and committed?
- **Technically Exciting** (5 points) - Is there genuine maker energy here?
- **Civic Exciting** (5 points) - Is the public-interest story strong with visible impact?

**Your DVF Score determines project support level:**

- **17-20**: Full CTWR support with regular check-ins and Demo Day slot
- **13-16**: Worth exploring with targeted coaching
- **8-12**: Significant risks - proceed with willing team and de-risk plan
- **4-7**: Not supported at this time

3. **Week 2-3**: Get feedback at CTWR meeting
4. **Week 3+**: Start with Technical Design if DVF score is 13+

### "My project doesn't need all this documentation"

Start with the essentials:

- Project Pitch (required for CTWR)
- DVF Scorecard (required for CTWR)
- Technical Design (if building software)
- Security Guide (if handling user data)
- GitHub Pages setup (if you need a public website)

### "How do I know if my project is civic tech?"

Civic tech projects:

- **Serve the public interest** - Address community problems
- **Engage community members** - Include affected people in the process
- **Build public capacity** - Make civic processes more accessible
- **Create public value** - Benefits extend beyond individual users

### "What if I'm not technical?"

- **Start with user research** - Technical solutions come after understanding problems
- **Partner with developers** - Use the Contributing guide to recruit technical help
- **Focus on design and process** - Many civic tech projects need more design than code
- **Use low-code tools** - Sometimes the best solution is a well-designed form or workflow
