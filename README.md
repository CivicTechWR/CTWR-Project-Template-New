## Quick Summary

This template provides everything needed for a successful CivicTechWR project: DVF framework integration, 12-week project lifecycle, comprehensive documentation, GitHub automation, security best practices, and public website hosting.

**Essential first steps:**

1. **[Complete the Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Your roadmap to success
2. **Fill out your Project Pitch** - Define your civic impact
3. **Run your DVF Assessment** - Score your project across 4 key lenses
4. **Set up your development environment** - Automated scripts included

> **For detailed guidance:** Read the **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - it breaks down the entire process with week-by-week instructions, common questions, and success metrics.

## DVF Assessment Score: [ /20]

Use the [DVF Scorecard](docs/DVF_SCORECARD.md) to evaluate your project across four lenses:

- **Community Partner**: [ /5] - Will partners consistently participate and bring value back to CTWR?
- **Talent & Team**: [ /5] - Is the team sized, skilled, diverse, and able to show up weekly?
- **Technically Exciting**: [ /5] - Is there genuine maker energy here?
- **Civic Exciting**: [ /5] - Is the public-interest story strong with visible community impact?

**Project Status:**

- **17-20**: CTWR-supported with regular check-ins and Demo Day slot
- **13-16**: Worth exploring with targeted coaching
- **8-12**: Significant risks - proceed with eager team willing to de-risk
- **4-7**: Not supported right now
