# [Project Name]

**CivicTechWR Season X Project**

> **Quick Start:** Replace this template with your project details and run your DVF assessment in Week 1-3.

## DVF Assessment Score: [ /20]

Use the [DVF Scorecard](docs/DVF_SCORECARD.md) to evaluate your project across four lenses:

- **Community Partner**: [ /5] - Will partners consistently participate and bring value back to CTWR?
- **Talent & Team**: [ /5] - Is the team sized, skilled, diverse, and able to show up weekly?
- **Technically Exciting**: [ /5] - Is there genuine maker energy here?
- **Civic Exciting**: [ /5] - Is the public-interest story strong with visible community impact?

**Project Status:**
- **17-20**: CTWR-supported with regular check-ins and Demo Day slot
- **13-16**: Worth exploring with targeted coaching
- **8-12**: Significant risks - proceed with eager team willing to de-risk
- **4-7**: Not supported right now
